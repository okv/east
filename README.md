# east

east - node.js database migration tool for different databases (extensible via
[adapters](#adapters)) with [transpiled languages support (e.g. TypeScript)](#typescript-and-other-transpiled-languages-support).

east connects to the db using particular adapter (mongodb, sqlite, postgres,
mysql, couchbase, couchdb), keeps track of executed migrations by storing their names
inside db and makes connect to the db available inside `migrate` and `rollback`
functions. east encourages you to use for migrations driver/syntax with which
you are already familiar with (apparently you use it for work with db at your
application) and doesn't provide universal api for working with any kind of
database.

Please note that particular adapter may have other requirements (see
documentation for specific adapter).


## Installation

```sh
npm install east -g
```

alternatively you could install it locally


## Changelog

All notable changes to this project documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

  *
  help [command]                      display help for command

```

run `east <command> -h` to see detailed command help.

All options described above can be set via command line or at `.eastrc` file
located at current directory, e.g.:

```js

{
	"dir": "./dbmigration",
	"template": "./lib/node/utils/customMigrationTemplate.js"
}

```

`.eastrc` also can be a regular commonjs module (instead of json file):

```js

var path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    dir: path.join(__dirname, 'dbmigration'),
    template: './lib/node/utils/customMigrationTemplate.js'
};

```

east also supports config as ECMAScript module, config could be:

```js
import path from 'path';

export const dir = path.resolve('dbmigration');
export const template = path.resolve('./lib/node/utils/customMigrationTemplate.js');
````

See [ECMAScript Modules support](#ecmascript-modules-support) for details.


### create

```sh
east create doSomething
```

produces something like this

```sh
New migration "1_doSomething" created at "migrations/1_doSomething.js"
```

the created file will contain

```js
exports.tags = [];

exports.migrate = async (client) => {

};

exports.rollback = async (client) => {

};
```

* `client` represents a connection to the current db and it's determined by the
adapter (see [adapters](#adapters) section)
* `done` callback may be defined as second argument - should be called at the
end of the migration (if any error occures you can pass it as the first argument)
* `rollback` function is optional and may be omitted

Migration file is a regular node.js module and allows migrating any database e.g.

```js
// include your database wrapper which you already use in app
const db = require('./db');

exports.migrate = async (client) => {
    await db.connect();
    await db.things.insert({_id: 1, name: 'apple', color: 'red'});
};

exports.rollback = async (client) => {
    await db.connect();
    await db.things.remove({_id: 1});
};
```

or you can use a special adapter for database (see [adapters](#adapters) section).


#### Migration file number format

The default format for migration file names is to prepend a number to the
filename which is incremented with every new file. This creates migration files
such as "migrations/1_doSomething.js", "migrations/2_doSomethingElse.js".

If you prefer your files to be created with a date-time instead of sequential
numbers, you can set the `migrationNumberFormat` configuration parameter in
your `.eastrc` to "dateTime":

```json
{
    "migrationNumberFormat": "dateTime"
}
```

This will create migration files with date-time prefix in `YYYYMMDDhhmmss`
format (e.g. "migrations/20190720172730_doSomething.js").

For the default behavior, you can omit the `migrationNumberFormat`
configuration option or set it to:

```json
{
    "migrationNumberFormat": "sequentialNumber"
}
```


### migrate

let's create one more migration

```sh
east create doSomethingElse
```

then executes both of them

```sh
east migrate
```

it sequentially executes all new migrations and produces

```sh
target migrations:
    1_doSomething
    2_doSomethingElse
migrate "1_doSomething"
migration done
migrate "2_doSomethingElse"
migration done
```

selected migrations can be executed by passing their names (or numbers or
basenames or paths) as an argument

```sh
east migrate 1_doSomething 2
```

in our case this command will skip all of them

```sh
skip "1_doSomething" because it's already executed
skip "2_doSomethingElse" because it's already executed
nothing to migrate
```

you can pass `--force` option to execute already executed migrations.
This is useful while you develop and test your migration.

You also can export `tags` array from migration and then run only
migrations that satisfy the expression specified by `--tag` option. The expression
consists of tag names and boolean operators `&`, `|` and `!`. For example,
the following command will run all migrations that have "tag1" tag and do not have "tag2" tag:

```sh
east migrate --tag 'tag1 & !tag2'
```


### rollback

`rollback` has similar to `migrate` command syntax but executes `rollback`
function from the migration file

```sh
east rollback
```

will produce

```sh
target migrations:
    2_doSomethingElse
    1_doSomething
rollback "2_doSomethingElse"
migration successfully rolled back
rollback "1_doSomething"
migration successfully rolled back
```


### list

```sh
east list
```

shows new migrations e.g.

```sh
new migrations:
     1_doSomething
     2_doSomethingElse
```

target status could be specified as an argument e.g.

```sh
east list executed
```


## Library usage

east exposes `MigrationManager` class (descendant of `EventEmitter`) which for
example can be used to migrate your database from node.js app without using
east cli:

```js
const {MigrationManager} = require('east');

const main = async () => {
    const migrationManager = new MigrationManager();

    // log target migrations before execution
    migrationManager.once('beforeMigrateMany', (migrationNames) => {
        console.log('Target migrations: ', migrationNames);
    });

    await migrationManager.configure();

    try {
        await migrationManager.connect();
        // select for migration all not executed migrations
        await migrationManager.migrate({status: 'new'});
    }
    finally {
        await migrationManager.disconnect();
    }
}

main().catch((err) => {
    console.error('Some error occurred: ', err.stack || err);
});
````

`MigrationManager` methods:

* **configure(params)** - configures migration process, accepts object with
parameters (`dir`, `adapter`, etc) and merges it with loaded config (when
`loadConfig` param is truthy - true by default). Returns *Promise<void>*. **This
method should be called before any other methods.**

* **getParams()** - returns *Promise* with parameters used by migration
process after configuration(`configure` method).

* **init()** - initiates migration process for a project. Should be called once
per project. Returns *Promise<void>*.

* **isInitialized()** - checks whether `init` was made or not.
Returns *Promise<Boolean>*.

* **create(basename)** - creates migration, returns *Promise* with migration
object.

* **getMigrationPath(name, migrationFileType)** - returns an absolute path of the migration
file on disk by the name of the migration, `migrationFileType` can be one of
"executable" or "source" ("executable" by default). Returns *Promise<String>*.

* **connect()** - connects to database management system (if supposed by
adapter). Returns *Promise<void>*.

* **getMigrationNames({migrations, status, tag, reverseOrderResult})** -
returns migrations names, following options are provided:

  * **migrations** - array of target migrations, each migration could be
  defined by basename, full name, path or number.
  * **status** - status to filter migrations, supported statuses are:
  "new", "executed" and "all".
  * **tag** - tag expression to filter migrations e.g. "tag1 & !tag2"
  * **reverseOrderResult** - if true then result array will be reversed.

`migrations` and `status` are mutually exclusive.
If `migrations`, `status` not provided then all migrations will be processed
(e.g. filtered by tag and returned).

* **migrate({migrations, status, tag, force})** - executes target migrations.
Target migration could be defined by `migrations`, `status`, `tag` options
(see it's description at `getMigrationNames` method). *By default*
migrations with status "new" are chosen. Returns *Promise<void>*. `force`
flag allows to execute already executed migrations.

* **rollback({migrations, status, tag, force})** - rollbacks target migrations.
Target migration could be defined by `migrations`, `status`, `tag` options
(see it's description at `getMigrationNames` method). *By default*
migrations with status "executed" are chosen. Returns *Promise<void>*. `force`
flag allows to rollback not executed migrations.

* **disconnect()** - disconnects from database management system (if supposed
by adapter). Returns *Promise<void>*.


`MigrationManager` events:

* **beforeMigrateOne({migration})**
* **afterMigrateOne({migration})**
* **beforeMigrateMany({migrationNames})**
* **afterMigrateMany({migrationNames})**
* **beforeRollbackOne({migration})**
* **afterRollbackOne({migration})**
* **beforeRollbackMany({migrationNames})**
* **afterRollbackMany({migrationNames})**
* **onSkipMigration({migration, reason})**


## Adapters

adapter determines where executed migration names will be stored and what will be
passed to `migrate` and `rollback` function as `client`.
Default adapter stores executed migration names at file `.migrations` which is
located at migrations executables directory and passes `null` as `client`.

Other adapters:
* [mongodb](https://github.com/okv/east-mongo)
* [sqlite](https://github.com/2do2go/east-sqlite)
* [postgres](https://github.com/2do2go/east-postgres)
* [mysql](https://github.com/riggerthegeek/east-mysql)
* [couchbase](https://github.com/ramiel/east-couchbase)
* [couchdb](https://github.com/schipiga/east-couchdb)
* [dynamodb](https://github.com/cstar-industries/east-dynamodb)


## Plugins

East functionality could be extended by using plugins, for usage instructions
see plugin page:

* [migration duration logger](https://github.com/okv/east-migration-duration-logger)
* [migration progress indicator helper](https://github.com/okv/east-migration-progress-indicator-helper)


## Creating own adapter

For writing your own adapter you should implement methods for connection,
mark transaction as executed, etc see details inside
[built-in adapter](lib/adapter.js) and [other adapters](#adapters).
See [TypeScript support](#typescript-and-other-transpiled-languages-support) for the details on the required
adapter interface.

You also can run migrator tests from current repository against your adapter:

* Clone current repository
* Change current directory to it
* Create file `.eastrc` with path and parameters for
your adapter e.g.

```js
{
    "adapter": "../../east-mysql/lib/adapter",
    "url": "mysql://user:password@localhost/east_test_db",
    "createDbOnConnect": true
}
```

* Run `NODE_EAST_TEST_LOAD_CONFIG=1 npm run testSpecified test/01-migrator -- --jobs=1` at
root of the cloned repository.


## TypeScript and other transpiled languages support

`east` allows you to opt-in writing and executing your migrations with any transpiled languages,
while by default it uses a single dir called "migrations" and looks for ".js" files in it.

You can configure separate executable and source files directories as well as
separate executable and source files extensions with `--dir`, `--source-dir`,
`--migration-extension`, `--source-migration-extension` respectively.

By default if you specify only `--dir` and/or `--migration-extension`, then
`--source-dir` and/or `--source-migration-extension` will be equal to it, however
it doesn't work on the other way around, e.g. if you specify

```
--source-dir mySourceDir --source-migration-extension ts
```

then `--dir` and `--migration-extension` will have `migrations` and `js` values by default,
so it is recommended to specify at least `--dir`, `--source-dir` and `--source-migration-extension`
when you are building a transpiled language.

If you use TypeScript you can run `east` with [`ts-node`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)
if you don't want to transpile you migration scripts before running them:

```sh
ts-node $(which east) migrate
```

Just be sure to specify `--migration-extension ts` so that `east` does look for
TypeScript files when `require()`-ing the migration scripts.


### TypeScript typings

`east` exposes TypeScript declarations of the `Adapter`, `MigrationManager`
and other related interfaces.

You can access it by importing the interfaces from `east` module itself:

```ts
import { DbClient } from 'some-mainstream-db';
import type { Adapter, AdapterConstructor } from 'east';

class MyAdapter implements Adapter<DbClient> {
	// go to definition of Adapter interface for documentation on required methods
	// you can also leverage your ide features to generate
	// stub method impementations here
}

// type-check the class static type (i.e. its constructor)
const _: AdpaterConstructor<DbClient> = MyAdapter;

export = MyAdapter;
```


## ECMAScript Modules support

east provides support for es modules by `--es-modules` cli flag.
With this flag config, migrations, adapter and plugins will be loaded using
[import expression](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_import_expressions).
It allows to provide those entities like commonjs or es modules, e.g.
`.eastrc.mjs`:

```js
import path from 'path';
export const dir = path.resolve('dbmigration');
export const template = path.resolve('./lib/node/utils/customMigrationTemplate.js');
````

Please note, that you need to enable nodejs es modules support (use `mjs`
extension for module or package.json with type "module", etc - see
[nodejs esm docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/esm.html) for
details).

Config presented above could be used like this:

```sh
east --config .eastrc.mjs --es-modules list
```

When migration files as es module are desired `--migration-extension` and
`--source-migration-extension` set to "mjs" could be used.
